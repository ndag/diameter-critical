# Project Overview

This repository contains scripts for analyzing diameter critical polygons on the sphere. 
The code was written by [Qingsong Wang](https://www.qingsong-wang.org/). 

See [Extremal spherical polytopes and Borsuk's conjecture](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.13076.pdf) by Mikhail Katz, Facundo Memoli and Qingsong Wang.

# Files

process_results.py: This script includes functions for processing results, such as extracting data from files and directories, and creating polygons from the extracted data.

dataset.py: This script contains functions for dataset construction and manipulation.

asp.py: This script is dedicated to the calculation of distances, implementation of the diameter descent algorithm, data updating, and other related tasks.

test.py: This is a placeholder for future test scripts.



# Getting Started

To use these scripts, clone the repository and ensure you have the required Python environment and dependencies installed.
